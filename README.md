# Appointment Planner

## Installation
 - clone, run `npm  install`, run `npm start`

## Goal
    The goal of this project was to practice using `useState()` and `useeffect()` hooks in React along with passing down state. During this project I also had an opportunity to try out some simple regex form validation. 

    This app allows users to create new contacts and add them to a list. Users can then create appointments referrencing their contacts.
